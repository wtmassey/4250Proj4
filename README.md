# CSCI 4250/5250 Project 4: 3D Scene with Three.js

## How to Run the Project

**Textures will NOT load if you open the HTML file directly (using file://).**

To view the scene with textures and all features, you must use a local web server

 Open a terminal in the folder containing your `three.html` file.
 Run:
   python -m http.server

 Open your browser and go to:
   http://localhost:8000/three.html
